I am using the [HTML9 Responsive Boilerstrap JS](http://html9responsiveboilerstrapjs.com/) for this website! It`s cross-universe compatible!! How awesome is that?!!!?!! You should definetly check it out!

Jokes aside, I was looking around for different frameworks and static page generators, but decided to just stick with pure html and css, as I just want to have a simple website.

Here is some inspiration I got for this site:
