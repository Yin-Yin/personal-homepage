# personal-homepage - Starry Night

See the site here: [Demo on Netlify](https://starry-sky-personal-homepage.netlify.com/)

I am using the [HTML9 Responsive Boilerstrap JS](http://html9responsiveboilerstrapjs.com/) for this website! It`s cross-universe compatible!! How awesome is that?!!!?!! You should definetly check it out!

Jokes aside, I was looking around for different frameworks and static page generators, but decided to just stick with pure html and css, as I just want to have a simple website.

### About the design
The motivation behind the design was that I wanted to convey a calmness that I value and make a hint to the roots of my love for programming that stems from playing around with old computers in my childhood.

### Useful for making this site:
 - [Why I dont`use placeholders for my website.](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/06/placeholder-attribute/)

 - [Great resource for responsive web design](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/responsive-design/)
 - [CSS star effect](https://codepen.io/angiebadfox/pen/RRdQAb)
